Question 1
Consider the following BlueJ program.
public class Mystery {
  
  /**
   * read file of mysterious phrases
   */
   
  public void DoSomething() {
    // initialize instance variables
    FileResource someFile = FileResource("phrases.txt");
    for (String phrase : someFile.lines()){
      System.out.println(phrase);
    }
  }
}
Which one of the following is the name of a method?
DoSomething <- Correct 
Mystery
phrase
someFile

Question 2
Consider the following Java class.
public class Thing {
  private int a;
  public Thing(int x) {
    a = x;
  }
  public int geta() {
    return a;
  }
  public void print() {
    int b = 4;
    System.out.println(geta() + " " + b);
  }
}
Which method is the constructor?
a
geta
print
Thing <- Correct 

Question 3
Consider the following Java class.
public class Thing {
  private int a;
  public Thing(int x) {
    a = x;
  }
  public int geta() {
    return a;
  }
}
And consider the following code segment that uses the class Thing.
Thing f = new Thing(3);
Thing g = new Thing(5);
Thing h = f;
Thing j = h;
How many Thing objects are created?
2 <- Correct Response 
A new object is created whenever the new keyword is used.

Question 4
Consider the following code segment that uses the edu.duke FileResource class. The method .length() calculates how many characters are inside a string. For example, for the string "puppy", .length() would calculate a value of 5. We will learn more about strings later in this course.
FileResource f = new FileResource("words.txt");
for (String g : f.lines()) {
  if (g.length() > 5) {
    System.out.println(g);
  }
} 
Suppose the file words.txt contains the following lines:

cat
elephant
monkey
tiger
lion
Which one of the following would be the output from this code segment?

Hint: Be sure to review the documentation for FileResource if you do are not sure what this class does or what methods it contains: http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/doc/.

elephant, monkey <- Correct 
This is the correct answer. Only words of length greater than five are printed.

elephant, monkey, tiger
cat, tiger, lion
cat, elephant, monkey, tiger, lion

Question 5
Consider the following Java class.
public class Thing {
  private int a;
  public Thing(int x) {
    a = x;
  }
  public int geta() {
    return a ;  
  }
  public void print() {
    int b = 4 ;
    System.out.println(geta() + " " + b);
  }
}
And consider the following code segment that uses the Thing class.
Thing f = new Thing(4);
System.out.println(f.geta());
Which one of the following is NOT a primitive type?
a
f <- Correct 
b
x
